# Face-Recognition
This is my first Computer Vision project about Real-time Face recognition python project with OpenCV using the Object Detection methods Cascade Classifiers and Haar Features.

# Cascade Classifiers and Haar Features:
Cascade Classifiers and Haar Features like we have said are the methods used for Object Detection.

Cascade Classifier is a machine learning algorithm where we train a cascade function with tons of images. These images are in two categories: positive images containing the target 
object and negative images not containing the target object.

There are different types of cascade classifiers according to different target objects. In our project, we will use a classifier that considers the human face to recognize it as 
the target object.

Haar Feature selection technique has a target to extract human face features. Haar features are like convolution kernels. These features are different permutations of black and 
white rectangles. In each feature calculation, we find the sum of pixels under white and black rectangles.
